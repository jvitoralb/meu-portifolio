    "aboutMe1": "I'm a Fullstack developer, and I've been creating web applications for 2 years. On the front end, I have experience developing static websites, with different technologies, such as complex frameworks and libraries like Reactjs and Vuejs, and simpler ones, like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. When it comes to the backend, I have greater familiarity and knowledge. I like working with the Microservices and REST architectural styles, and I always seek to assure the code quality using automated tests following the TDD standard.<span class=\"break-line\"></span>When I'm working, I value good development practices and design patterns, as I believe it helps to write more sustainable code.",
